#Task 3.4
###### Select Statement
I pulled only the film_id and title from the film table as it was all that was needed. 

SELECT film_is, title
FROM film

###### Order BY Statement
I ran a query that selects every film from the “film” table, with the movies sorted by title from A to Z, then by most recent release year, and then by highest to lowest rental rate.

SELECT title
FROM film 
ORDER BY title ASC

SELECT title, release_year
FROM film
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC

SELECT title, release_year, rental_rate 
FROM film
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC

###### Min and Max
I found the minimum and maximum rental duration from the film category

SELECT rating, MAX(rental_duration)
FROM film
GROUP BY rating

SELECT rating, MIN(rental_duration)
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
