# Achievement5SQL
This is for my data analytics course and the SQL written throughout it (task 5.6).

This repository is for Achievement 3 of my data analytics course.  I was hired as a data analyst for Rockbuster, a movie rental company.  I was tasked to help with the launch strategy for their new online service.  I loaded their data into an RDBMS and used SQL to analyze it.  I used this infomarmation to answer ad hoc business questions and put together a presentation for the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
