Task 3.8 
Write a subquery and query:

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid.total_amount_paid) AS average
FROM
(SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
WHERE D. city IN ('Aurora', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl', 'Atlixco')
GROUP BY B.customer-id, B.first_nam,e B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid;

Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

SELECT DISTINCT(D.country), COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS total_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT D.country) AS top_csutomer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
WHERE D. city IN ('Aurora', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl', 'Atlixco')
GROUP BY B.customer-id, B.first_nam,e B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY SUM (A.amount) DESC
MILIT 5) AS top_five_customers
ON D.country, top_five_customers
ORDER BY total_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
